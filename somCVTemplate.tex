% Headings	
% ALL HEADINGS AND SUBHEADINGS ARE REQUIRED and are shown in the order they must appear on your CV.
% Additional, optional headings are in the CV available online. 
% If there is no data to report, please add the heading and respond “None”, with the following exception: 
% If you do not have ANY DATA to report in a SECTION (as identified below in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS), 
% then list “None” to the right of the section heading and do not include
% the subsequent headings within that section.

% Only the candidate’s name should be bolded throughout the CV. 
% Do not bold journal titles, society names or mentee names. Mentee names should be underlined in publications.

% Dates should be in chronological order – list earliest date first under each heading, place at the left margin, and
% show numerically with no extra zeroes for months or days. Use these styles:
% Year: 1997	
% Month and Year: 1/77
% Year to Year: 1977-1979		
% Month/Day/Year: 5/1/77
% Year to present: 1997-present	
% Month/DAYS/Year: 5/1-23/77
% Year to Month/Year: 1977-2/85	
% Month/Year to Month/Year: 5/77-2/85
% Month/Year to Month/Day/Year: 1/77-2/15/85
% Month/Day/Year to Month/Day/Year: 5/1/77-2/2/85 

% Do not (1) double space between responses or (2) duplicate data in multiple sections/subsections. 
% It is acceptable to respond “Please refer to…” rather than adding duplicate data.

% Regional is best defined as community (non‐university, non‐federal) institutions within a 50‐100 mile radius of
% Baltimore or any facility that is a part/affiliated with JHMI. Excludes Univ. PA, Georgetown, NIH, etc., which are
% not currently considered as “regional” despite their geographic proximity to Baltimore.

% Focus paragraphs are required. Include information you would like to highlight for the committee or that may
% not otherwise fall under a specific heading elsewhere on the CV.
